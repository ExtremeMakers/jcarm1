== Features of the Library ==

The JC-ARM I library provides the following functionalities for controlling the robotic arm:
begin(int servoVerticalPin, int servoHorizontalPin, int servoBasePin, int servoClawPin): Initializes the servos of the robotic arm with the specified pins.
rotateBaseTo(int ang): Rotates the base of the robotic arm to a specified angle.
grab(int ang): Controls the claw of the arm, allowing it to open and close at a specified angle.
moveClawTo(double x, double y): Moves the claw to a specific position (x, y), calculating the necessary angles for the servos.

== How to Use ==

To use the JC-ARM I library, include the JCARMI.h file in your Arduino project and instantiate an object of the JCARMI class. Use the available methods to control the robotic arm as needed.
